This is just a collection of solutions for Project Euler problems. I chose C to because that's my primary language at the moment. If you haven't solved these problems, give them a try first. 

"Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills
and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of
mathematics."
